As we try to decipher meaningful data behind our day-to-day analysis, we are often exposed
to data that suffers from large volumes. One of the most common problems of machine learning is
Breast Cancer is often considered the most common type of cancer among women. It has a mortality
rate of about 2.5 % and especially higher in women of color. Multiple socio-economic reasons as well
as genetic conditions can cause the cancer. In near futureThis research aims to improve an existing
Breast Cancer prediction model first published in 1992 by Dr. William H. Wolberg at University of
Wisconsin. The last prediction model was published in 1995 by W.H. Wolberg, W.N. Street, D.M.
Heisey, and O.L. Mangasarian called “Computer-derived nuclear features distinguish malignant
from benign breast cytology.” The accuracy of the prediction model back in 1990 was about 93.5 %
followed but the paper in 1992 with accuracy about 95.7 %. The project aims to use Normalization
techniques to improve the accuracy of breast cancer prediction. The classification was done using
the KNN (nearest neighbor) model as it was used in past research papers. Normalization method
used were Standard, Min- Max Scaling, Mean Absolute Deviation, Median Absolute deviation
which sometimes is known as MAD around Mean/Median. All these normalization techniques use
different statistical parameters. The independent s study had about 569 instances of patient tissue
samples processed using XCYT Software which test for 30 different distinct features. This raw
data was processed in Python to train, split and test the data model using classification methods
followed by various normalization techniques. All the various results were studied and researched
concluded the best accuracy was given by Min- Max scaling of about 97.66 % much better than
the past published models and models tested in the research. In near future, AI and ML can play
a significant role in healthcare especially disease prediction and prevention.
